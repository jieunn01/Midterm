	<h2> This question is also hard to chosse.</h2>
	<h2> Homebody in the weekend  </h2><br>
	<p> I prefer this more than hang out. It is really busy at home it means so many things to do at home. </p><br>

	<h3> Watching netflex series on the bed in most comfortable position is the best. after that, find some recipes and cooking and eating ! finally before go to bed, reading some pages of the books.  Best SBest weekend.
	</h3>

	<h3> It is the only time that we can go outside without work. </h3><br>
	<h3> Some people might think it is boring at home in the weekend. The best thing is going outside and meet firends ! </h3><br>

	<p> The most interesting time shopping. It is not really tired when we lokking for the new items. I can realize the reason why I work. Watching the movie in theater and netflex is totally different, amaizing sound and effects on huge screen. Find some nice cafe and spend time in there such as writing diary and reading a book, it is happiness!
	</p>
	<br>
	<p>Also it is hard to meet firends in working day, so we need to meet people in weekend. Make happy memories with firends.</p>
