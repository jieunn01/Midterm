## Description
This is midterm for 1054-02-20F.
Building a 1 page app. Pick a subject that you can disagree with - both points of view should appear in the first submission. 
Use what we've covered so far(Terminal, Git and Git hub) to create a simple 1 page HTML application. A few paragraphs of text for each point of view and at least one image for each is required. Merge everything to the master branch when you're finished. Do code reviews before you merge. Push the finished files to your repo, double check to make sure you've merged everything to the master branch and submit the repo URL to the FOL dropbox.
